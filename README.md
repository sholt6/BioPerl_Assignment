# BioPerl Assignment
This script was written to satisfy a coursework requirement of the MSc Bioinformatics module Perl. The goal was to write a pipeline which:
* Read a protein sequence from a FASTA file
* Searched this protein sequence against a local copy of the Swissprot database
* Parsed the results to print the top ten hits to a file (hits.txt)
* Retrieved the sequences of these ten hits and wrote them to a file (hits.fasta)
* Produced a multiple sequence alignment using Muscle and wrote this to a file (hits.aln)
* Opened hits.aln in ClustalX

The grade awarded for this work was 91%.
